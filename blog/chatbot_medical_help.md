Chatbots have tremendous potential to help people address their medical questions. A [2023 JAMA Internal Medicine publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37115527/) already showed that ChatGPT answers were rated by clinicians as higher quality than clinician answers ~80% of the time, and chatbots are only improving. There are many inherent advantages that chatbots have that are worth emphasizing:  
1. Minimal effort. People usually wait to see a doctor until "it's bad enough.". This is because of the time and monetary cost of going to a medical appointment.
1. Free
1. Immediacy. Answers are available immediately. In the best case, this can save lives.
1. The answers are written down. Everyone has had the experience of being barraged with information and words we don't understand during a medical visit. We feel later that we couldn't understand or remember things from the visit.
1. Less embarrassment. Chatbots don't make you feel as embarrassed about ignorant questions and describing personal things.

I've evaluated chatbots abilities to answer medical advice and there are several major limitations currently:  
1. Visual inspection. It's hard to get a good image of inside your throat or a good image of a skin change.
2. Any thing that requires a specialized tool or test.

Problems shared by human medical practitioners and chatbots:  
1. Treating the average. Medical practitioners and chatbots are providing answers that are appropriate for the average person, but no one is the average.
1. Both recommend treatments that are often worse than no treatment.
1. Not following up sufficiently long in the future to evaluate whether recommended treatments worked.

Regarding data privacy, I don't believe having medical records stored by an EHR is inherently safer than having them stored by chatbot company.
